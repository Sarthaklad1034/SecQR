# SecQR - Secure QR Code Scanning with AI

SecQR is an AI-powered QR code scanner that identifies and warns users about malicious URLs. It uses a combination of machine learning and a database of known URLs to determine the safety of a link. If the URL is flagged as dangerous, the user is immediately alerted. Additionally, SecQR leverages database overrides to ensure that AI predictions are accurate, with safe or malicious URLs categorized and checked against the database.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- MongoDB (v4.4 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secqr.git
cd secqr
```

2. Set up backend environment
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your environment variables
```

3. Set up frontend environment
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env  # Configure your environment variables
```

4. Configure environment variables
   - Backend `.env`: Add your MongoDB connection string, API keys, etc.
   - Frontend `.env`: Add your API endpoint

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

### Frontend Structure
- `components/`: Reusable UI components
- `pages/`: Application pages
- `services/`: API connection services
- `assets/`: Images, CSS, and other static assets

### Backend Structure
- `routes/`: API endpoints
- `services/`: Business logic services
- `models/`: Machine learning model
- `utils/`: Helper functions

## </> API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/scan` | POST | Decode QR code image and analyze URL |
| `/api/checksafe-url` | POST | Analyze a safe URL directly |
| `/api/checkmalicious-url` | POST | Analyze a malicious URL directly |

## üß† Machine Learning Model

The URL classifier is trained on a dataset of both safe and malicious URLs. It extracts features such as:
- URL length
- Domain age and reputation
- Special character frequency
- TLD analysis
- Path analysis

The model file is stored in `backend/models/url_classifier.pkl` and is loaded at runtime.

## üîú Future Enhancements

- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] History of scanned QR codes
- [ ] Browser extension
- [ ] Offline scanning capabilities
- [ ] Advanced threat intelligence integration
